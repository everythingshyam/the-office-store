# A Dynamic Stationary Website

#### A static stationary website started as a 5th Semester Assignment, now a medium-scale e-commerce website in the making...

## Development Setup

-   This project requires no additional setup other than tailwind CSS.
-   Assuming you have node installed, Run the command "npm install" or equivalent to install the dependancies.
-   Next, run the following command to start the tailwind server:
`npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./src/styles.css --watch`

This is a dynamic, medium-scale e-commerce website for stationary and office items. It uses HTML, CSS and Javascript for the frontend and PHP and MySQL for the backend.

This was made way back in 2021, with limited functionalities, for an assignment in my college. Now, I am in the process of converting it into a properly working, and elegant-looking e-commerce website.
