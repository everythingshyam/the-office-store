# A Dynamic Stationary Website ([View Live Website](https://everythingshyam.github.io/the-office-store/))

#### A static stationary website started as a 5th Semester Assignment, now a medium-scale e-commerce website for office and stationary products, in the making.

## Development Setup
-   This project requires no additional setup other than tailwind CSS.
-   Assuming you have node installed, Run the command "npm i" or equivalent to install the dependancies.
-   Next, run the following command to start the tailwind server in a seperate terminal (this will watch for changes in your css file and update the output file accordingly):
`npx tailwindcss -i ./src/styles/index.css -o ./src/styles/styles.css --watch`
-   Finally, open the index.html file in your browser. (I recommend using live server extension in VS Code)

This is a simple e-commerce website for office and stationary products. It is made using `HTML`, `Tailwind CSS`, `JavaScript` and `XML`.

This was made way back in 2021, with limited functionalities, as an assignment in my college. Now, I am in the process of converting it into a properly working, and elegant-looking e-commerce website.
