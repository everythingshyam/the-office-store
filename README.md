# StationaryWebsite
A static stationary website | Started as a 5th Semester Assignment
This website uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript for frontend, and uses PHP and MySQL to store and retrieve user and cart order databases.
Currently, the front end is almost ready. Now, I am working on the backend part.
