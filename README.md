# A Dynamic Stationary Website

#### A static stationary website started as a 5th Semester Assignment, now a medium-scale e-commerce website in the making...

This is a dynamic, medium-scale e-commerce website for stationary and office items. It uses HTML, CSS and Javascript for the frontend and PHP and MySQL for the backend.

This was made way back in 2021, with limited functionalities, for an assignment in my college. Now, I am in the process of converting it into a properly working, and elegant-looking e-commerce website.
